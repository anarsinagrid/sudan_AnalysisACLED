        <h1>What Changed in Sudan After April 2023?</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">
            A popular movement interrupted — and how violence reorganized a country
        </p>
        <p>
            Sudan, a country anchored by the Nile and centuries of cultural exchange — from the Nubian kingdoms of
            Napata and Meroe to Khartoum’s modern music and literary scenes — with economic fundamentals in irrigated
            agriculture, livestock, gum arabic, gold, and regional trade.
            In another trajectory, the civic energy of the pre-war years could have gone into building institutions,
            services, and cultural life rather than survival and displacement.
            Before that collapse, Sudan also held space for cultural and civic achievement: the 2019–2022 protest
            movement itself showed coordinated public action across cities, documented in open sources such as the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932022_Sudanese_protests#:~:text=The%202019%E2%80%932022%20Sudanese%20protests,toxic%20effects%20of%20cyanide%20and"

        </p>
        <p>
            This analysis asks a narrow but important question: what structurally changed in Sudan after April 15, 2023?
            Rather than treating the war as a sudden escalation of an already violent situation, the goal is to show how
            the form of political activity, the actors involved, the geography of harm, and the visibility of death
            itself were reorganized.

            The figures that follow are not intended to measure suffering precisely.
            They are intended to show how violence became the dominant system through which power, survival, and control
            were exercised.

            <h2>Before the War, There Was a Movement</h2>

            <p>
                Long before April 2023, Sudan's streets were already political.
                Ordinary citizens gathered again and again, not with weapons,
                but with chants, signs, and a growing belief that collective pressure could reshape power.
            </p>

            <p>
                Protest was not an exception to daily life.
                It was becoming part of it.
            </p>

            <p>
                These were not isolated eruptions of anger.
                They were sustained, repeated, and spread across cities —
                slowly building confidence and coordination.
            </p>

            <p>
                The data from this period does not simply show more events.
                It shows structure.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sudan was not drifting toward chaos.
                It was actively experimenting with civic pressure.
            </p>

            <p>
                What matters about this period is not simply that protests occurred, but that they were repeated,
                coordinated, and sustained.
                Event data from this phase shows regular civic activity across multiple locations, indicating that
                protest had become a routine political tool, not an exceptional outburst.
            </p>

            <p>
                This matters because it establishes a baseline: political participation existed and was observable.
                The disappearance of protests later is therefore not a mystery to be explained away, but a phenomenon
                that requires explanation.

            <p class="act-label">ACT II — Tension</p>
            <h2>Power Was Watching</h2>

            <p>
                As protest activity stabilized, tension moved elsewhere.
                Away from the streets and into military bases, negotiation rooms, and command structures.
            </p>

            <p>
                Violence had not yet displaced protest,
                but it increasingly surrounded it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Armed actors were present.
                Negotiations stalled.
                The country was still moving — but toward a narrowing set of outcomes.
            </p>

            <h2>April 15, 2023</h2>

            <p>
                On April 15, the logic of political participation collapsed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Armed conflict erupted between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces,
                transforming cities into battlefields and civilians into immediate targets.
            </p>

            <p>
                From this moment on, survival replaced mobilization as the dominant concern.
            </p>

            <p>
                The days around April 15 should not be understood as a gradual slide.
                They represent a discrete collapse of one political logic and the sudden activation of another.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once armed conflict began between the Sudanese Armed Forces (<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_Armed_Forces" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">SAF</a>) and the Rapid Support Forces (<a

                    rel="noopener noreferrer">RSF</a>),
                the costs of public political presence increased dramatically.
                From this point forward, participation in collective action carried risks comparable to being in a
                battle zone.
            </p>

            <p>
                This transition is what the remaining figures aim to document.
            </p>

                The humanitarian implications were immediate and regionwide (<a

            <h2>When Violence Became the System</h2>

            <p>
                The most visible consequence of the war was not a single spike in deaths,
                but the establishment of a new and sustained level of lethality.
            </p>

            <p>
                After April 15, fatalities rose sharply and remained far above anything observed before.
                This was not a temporary surge — it was a structural shift.
            </p>

            <p>
                April 15, 2023 marks the start of open warfare between the SAF and RSF.
                The immediate spike that follows captures urban combat, shelling, and civilians suddenly exposed inside
                battle zones — not a single incident, but a rapid change in how and where fighting occurred.

                    How to read this: Look for the step change after April 15 rather than a single peak. The apparent
                    mid‑2024 dip should not be read as peace — indirect deaths and reporting lags suppress counts. The
                    return of steeper lines in late 2024–2025 signals renewed urban offensives.
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <p>
                The apparent decline in early–mid 2024 does not mean violence eased.
                As frontlines stalled, civilians died from siege, starvation, disease, and displacement — harms that are
                systematically underreported in event data and therefore depress the visible curve.
                (See famine context: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine_in_Sudan_(2024%E2%80%93present)"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2024–present famine</a>).
            </p>

            <p>
                By late 2024 and into 2025, RSF–SAF offensives resumed, including contestation of major cities such as
                Al Fasher (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_El_Fasher" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">Siege of El Fasher</a>).
                Urban re-entry and artillery use drove documented fatalities back up, even as indirect deaths continued
                outside the narrow scope of battle reports.
            </p>

            <p>
                The timeline also reveals quieter phases that are easy to misread.
                In early 2024, reported fatalities appear to decline.
            </p>

            <p>
                This does not reflect peace.
                It reflects stalemate.
            </p>

            <p>
                As frontlines froze, mortality increasingly came from starvation,
                disease, and siege conditions — deaths that are slower and harder to document.
            </p>

            <p>
                By late 2024, large-scale offensives returned,
                bringing renewed intensity to Khartoum, Gezira, and Darfur.
            </p>

            <p>
                This figure shows monthly aggregated fatalities from ACLED, which is crucial for interpretation.
                Monthly aggregation smooths day-to-day volatility and highlights structural changes, not tactical noise.
            </p>

            <p>Three analytically distinct phases are visible:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>April 2023: Structural break, not a spike.</strong>
                    The sharp rise beginning in April 2023 reflects the onset of open warfare.
                    Urban fighting, artillery use, and the collapse of civilian–military separation exposed large
                    populations to direct harm.
                    What matters is not the height of the first peak, but the fact that fatalities never return to
                    pre-April levels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Early–mid 2024: Apparent decline.</strong>
                    The visible dip in 2024 is easy to misread.
                    This is not a peace dividend.
                    Instead, frontlines hardened, sieges expanded, and harm shifted toward starvation, disease, and
                    displacement — forms of death that are systematically under-captured in event datasets like ACLED.
                    In other words, the curve drops because the violence becomes less event-like, not because it becomes
                    less deadly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Late 2024–2025: Renewed increase.</strong>
                    As contested cities such as Al Fasher re-enter active battle phases, fatalities rise again.
                    Urban re-entry produces documented deaths because violence becomes more visible, more reportable,
                    and more concentrated.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                <strong>Key takeaway:</strong>
                This graph should be read as a record of how violence is expressed and documented, not as a complete
                ledger of human loss.

            <p>
                War does not only increase violence.
                It changes what kinds of actions are even possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                The disappearance of protests here should not be read as public disengagement.
                It reflects that mass gatherings became physically unsafe and were reclassified as clashes or were
                prevented entirely, shifting observable activity into armed categories.
            </p>

            <p>
                When reading the next figure, focus on which event types occupy the space once held by protest, and
                avoid assuming that fewer protests imply acquiescence — the opportunity structure, not the grievances,
                changed.

                    How to read this: Watch the proportion of each event type over time, not the exact counts. Rising
                    shares of battles and strategic attacks indicate militarization; falling protest share reflects lost
                    civic space, not necessarily reduced dissent.

                This figure explains what replaced protest once war began.
                Before April 2023, protest and civil unrest occupy a meaningful share of observed events.
                After April 2023, battles and strategic violence dominate the composition.
            </p>

            <p>
                The critical point is not that protests decline, but what takes their place.
                Political grievances do not disappear — they are displaced into armed confrontation.
            </p>

            <p>When interpreting this figure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Focus on relative proportions, not totals.</li>
                <li>A higher share of battles indicates militarization of political conflict.</li>
                <li>The loss of protest reflects loss of civic space, not consent or apathy.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This shift marks the moment when violence becomes the primary language of politics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before April 2023, protests were a dominant form of political expression.
                After the war began, they were no longer viable.
            </p>

            <p>
                Battles and military operations filled the space protests once occupied.
                Violence against civilians did not disappear —
                it persisted even as the scale of violence expanded.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <p>
                These timelines show when different forms of activity rise and fall.
                The most important pattern is the inverse relationship between protest and armed activity.
                As protests disappear, armed actions surge.
            </p>

            <p>
                This crossover does not indicate that grievances vanished.
                It marks the point where collective civilian action became too dangerous to sustain, and organized
                violence took its place.

            <p>
                Temporal alignment between actor activity and the fatalities curve reinforces the idea that political
                participation was not suppressed gradually, but replaced structurally.

            <h2>Who Fought — and How</h2>

            <p>
                Although often described as a single conflict,
                the war is shaped by two very different patterns of violence.
            </p>

            <p>
                SAF operations concentrate on conventional battles and territorial control.
                RSF actions more often target civilians or use coercive tactics away from formal frontlines, producing
                different harm profiles even when headline event counts look similar.
            </p>

            <p>
                Read the actor charts as complementary: overlapping spikes do not mean identical behavior.
                Pay attention to where each actor’s activity sits on the spectrum from combat to civilian targeting.
            </p>
            <p>
                External trackers underscore this asymmetry and its stakes (<a

                This figure separates how different actors use violence.
                Although SAF and RSF are often discussed together, their patterns differ.
            </p>

            <p>
                SAF activity is weighted toward conventional battles and territorial engagement.
                RSF activity is more strongly associated with violence against civilians and coercive control away from
                formal frontlines.
            </p>

            <p>
                These differences matter because they shape who is harmed, where, and how predictably.
                This is not a symmetric conflict; similar event counts do not imply similar strategies or impacts.

            <p>
                The consequences of the war are national,
                but the violence itself is highly concentrated.
            </p>

            <p>
                Concentration does not mean safety elsewhere; it reflects where incidents are documented and where
                forces are entrenched.
                Absence of color on the map can indicate under-reporting or temporary displacement of fighting, not
                guaranteed calm.

                This map shows where violence concentrates, not where suffering exists.
                Dark regions indicate repeated, documented events — typically areas with strategic value, entrenched
                forces, or better reporting access.

            <p>
                Lighter regions should not be interpreted as safe.

                The map reveals that while the war has national consequences, its most visible violence is

            <p>
                April 15, 2023 did not mark the beginning of violence in Sudan.
                It marked the collapse of civic space under sustained armed conflict.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is not an aftermath in the usual sense.
                The war has continued beyond the window shown in this report, and so has the suffering.
            </p>

            <p>
                The analysis stops where the dataset stops: the latest event date in the data used here is January 23,
                2025.
                What comes after is not an "after" in reality - it is beyond the boundary of observation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Protest did not disappear because people stopped caring.
                It disappeared because war made collective presence impossible.
            </p>

            <p>
                The war did not erase political demand in Sudan.
                It erased the conditions under which political participation could safely occur.
                The data shows a transition from organized civic pressure to enforced silence, mediated through
                violence.
                Understanding this shift is essential for interpreting both the conflict and any future attempts at
                political reconstruction.
