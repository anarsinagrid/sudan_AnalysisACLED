    <!-- CORE QUESTION -->
    <div class="text">
        <h2>The Core Question</h2>
        <p>
            Sudan has lived with political violence for years. Protests, unrest, and civilian harm were already part of
            daily life.
        </p>
        <p>
            So what actually changed on April 15, 2023?
        </p>
        <p>
            The data does not suggest a clean break from peace to chaos. Instead, it shows a structural transformation
            in how violence is expressed.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- F1: STRUCTURAL BREAK -->
    <div class="text">
        <h2>Fatalities After April 15</h2>
        <p>
            The most obvious effect of the war was an increase in fatalities. This was not a spike or a singular event.
            After April 15, fatalities rose sharply and stayed at a new, much higher level.
        </p>
    </div>

            Fatalities surge after April 15, 2023 and remain far above pre-war levels.

    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <p>
            The timeline reveals distinct phases. In early 2024, there is a visible drop in reported fatalities and
            violent events.
            This period reflects a strategic stalemate after the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) captured Gezira State in
            late 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this time, the primary drivers of mortality shifted from direct combat to starvation and disease.
            Famine conditions took hold, particularly in Darfur, producing what can be described as "silent deaths."
        </p>
        <p>
            By late 2024, violence escalated again. The RSF launched an all-out siege on El Fasher in North Darfur,
            while the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) initiated major offensives in Khartoum and Gezira to recapture
            territory.

        <h2>How Violence Changed Form</h2>
        <p>
            The second obvious effect of the war was a reordering of event types and the persistence of civilian harm.
        </p>
    </div>

            persistent.

    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <p>
            Before April 2023, protests were a prominent feature of Sudan’s political landscape.
            After the war began, protests declined sharply and were replaced by battles and strategic military
            operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Violence against civilians, however, remained a consistent feature of the conflict,
            accounting for roughly one-fifth of events both before and after the war began.

    <!-- ACTORS -->
    <div class="text">
        <h2>The Main Actors of the War</h2>
        <p>
            The war is primarily shaped by two armed actors whose approaches to violence differ markedly.
        </p>
    </div>

        <div class="caption">
            RSF events are more strongly associated with violence against civilians, while SAF events are more
            battle-heavy.

    </div>

    <div class="text">
        <p>
            The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) operate as a paramilitary organization with a decentralized structure,
            while the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) function as a conventional state military.
            These structural differences are reflected in how each actor appears in the data.

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <div class="text">
        <h2>What the Data Shows</h2>
        <p>
            April 15, 2023 marks the moment Sudan’s political violence reorganized into sustained armed conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
            The war did not eliminate civilian harm or protest overnight, but it fundamentally changed
            who was fighting, where violence concentrated, and how conflict unfolded over time.
